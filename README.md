Bihichi :dash:
===========
Bihichi (Farsi word, means without anything) is a MVC framwork for php with educational purposes :smiling_imp:. The main goal of this repository is getting a deep understanding about the mechanism of a web application framework, from the begining of the getting a request from a client til it make the response and pass it to a user :sweat_drops:.

## Origin
This framework is heavily inspired from what I learnt and saw in [Yii2](http://yiiframework.com/) and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) frameworks. I was preparing myself for an interview and I asked myself: "Can you work with php without any framework?" and the answer was so vague for me, so I started to implementing this framework to find my holes :sweat_smile: and filling them.

## Installation
Bihichi only can be cloned or downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/meysampg/bihichi/releases). For the mentioned purpose, even it doesn't support `Composer` :satisfied:. You could clone it, change it and learn from it (Of course if you have made a modification or add support a feature, please send a [pull request](https://github.com/meysampg/bihichi/compare) to help other for understanding more :revolving_hearts:).

## Todo
